## Some logical operators

-   == does this match?

-   != do these not match

-   \>, \<, \>=, \<=

-   &, \| or

```{r}
# Does 4 match 5
4 == 5
# does 4 match 4
4 == 4 
# does 4 not match 5
4 != 5
# does 4 not match 4
4 != 4

#does 4 match "4"
4 == "4"

#with assigned variables
cat <- 10
dog <- 7

cat > dog

#is dog greater than cat, OR is cat less than 20 - 1 is right so it shows true
dog > cat | cat < 20

#is dog less than cat AND cat == 10
dog < cat & cat == 10
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = mpg, color = wt)) +
  labs(x = "car weight (1000 pounds)",
       y = "Gas mileage (mpg)",
       title = "Car weight efficiency relationship")
```
